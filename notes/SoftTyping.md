an attempt to combine static and dynamic typing as well.

# 3 Criteria for a Soft Type System

programmer perspective: a dynamically typed language that provides feedback on possible type errors.

compiler-writer perspective: a statically typed language

**Minimal-Text-Principle** declaring types is not a requirement.

**Minimal-Failure-Principle** leave as much component as possible unchanged if it's safe to do so.

- not sure about the difference between this (always typecheck?) and gradual type
