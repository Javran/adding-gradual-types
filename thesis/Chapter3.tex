\chapter{Challenges and Solutions}

\section{Extension to Type Systems}

(Need to be re-organized)

introducing a dynamic type (changes to type judgment)

subtyping (consistency and transitivity)

Or: improve type system precision

using predicates
constraints as type level computation (requires a type system of sufficient expressiveness)

typing structural data

nominal
- structural

\section{Object-Oriented Programming}

object identity

giving `this` / `self` special type treatment

inheritance (could merge with subtyping)

variable / member mutation

\section{Implementation and Performance}

cast insertion

Large array

runtime check overhead

language-specific challenges

\chapter{Related Work}

(TODO) sound gradual typing is nominally alive and well


TypeScript implements "occurrence typing" (see "Type Guards and Differentiating Types" of advanced types) and Array as tuple
