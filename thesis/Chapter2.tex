\chapter{Extending existing languages}

It is not a trivial work to extend existing languages to support gradual typing,
as it involves understanding not just language features,
but also idiom and practice commonly used among its community to allow
a smooth and non-intrusive experience.

In these chapter we will go through some works that extend existing programming
language to support gradual typing.

\section{From JavaScript to Safe TypeScript}

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language widely used in web techniques.
One noticeable work of JavaScript extension is Safe TypeScript by Rastogi, Swamy, Fournet, Bierman \& Vekris.
It features a sound type system and efficient runtime type information(RTTI)-based
gradual typing.

\subsection{Type Checking for Free}

In JavaScript, one cannot declare a variables to have a specific type,
which usually leads to the style in which function checks its argument type at runtime
before proceeding with actual implementation:

\begin{verbatim}
function f(x) {
    if (typeof x !== 'string') {
        // throw error
    }
    return x + '!';
}
\end{verbatim}

By extending the language with an optional type annotation,
the code is cleaner in Safe TypeScript: 

\begin{verbatim}
function f(x : string) {
    return x + '!';
}
\end{verbatim}

Here the logic for checking whether $x$ is a string is removed,
instead, Safe TypeScript compiles it to insert code for type checking,
and throws with error messages upon failure.

By introducing type annotations, programmers get not just dynamic type checking without
much effort, but also enables static type checking. Consider the following code with $f$
above in scope:

\begin{verbatim}
f('one'); // good
f(1); // bad
\end{verbatim}

While manual type checking in function bodies throws when the bad call is invoked,
Safe TypeScript is capable of capturing the error ahead of execution.

\subsection{Nominal class and structural interfaces}


NOTES

(probably showcasing)

Object as map

Object in the sense of OOP

\subsection{RTTI and Performance}

\section{Typed Scheme}

occurrence typing

simple macros

structural typing to match for Python's duck typing

CSharp (this being the only static language that wants interaction with dynamic ones)

syntactic improvement
