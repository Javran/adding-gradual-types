- Object-oriented programming

- an object is always an instance of a class, which can:

    - hold state (reference to other objects)
    - receive a message from itself / other object
    - send messages while procesing one

    - states are always private
    - primitive types are also objects

- Subclassing

- classes are objects (of metaclass of that class (?)) too.

- Code blocks are Smalltalk's way of expression anonymous functions

- Reflection
