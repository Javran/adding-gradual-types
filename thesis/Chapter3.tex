\chapter{Challenges and Solutions}

Having explored syntactic improvements to gradual type extensions,
this chapter discusses how there are implemented to unveil common and language-specific
challenges and solutions about them.

\section{Extensions to Type Systems}

Supporting Gradual type system consists of two parts.
First, it requires traditional static types including basic type, function type and types for structural data.
Second, it is necessary to introduce a dynamic type to allow incomplete type information to present in programs.

\subsection{Extending From Static Type Systems}

\subsection{Extending From Dynamic Type Systems}

\section{Dealing with Structural Data}

(Need to be re-organized)

introducing a dynamic type (changes to type judgment)

subtyping (consistency and transitivity)

Or: improve type system precision

using predicates
constraints as type level computation (requires a type system of sufficient expressiveness)

typing structural data

nominal
- structural

object identity

giving `this` / `self` special type treatment

inheritance (could merge with subtyping)

variable / member mutation

\section{Other Performance Concerns}

cast insertion

Large array

runtime check overhead

\section{Language-specific Challenges}

\chapter{Related Work}

(TODO) sound gradual typing is nominally alive and well


TypeScript implements "occurrence typing" (see "Type Guards and Differentiating Types" of advanced types) and Array as tuple
